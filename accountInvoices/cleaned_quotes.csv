S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,They're the worst.
S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,"Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?"
S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,"Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there."
S06E23,The Face Painter,George,"Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room."
S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,Big matzoh ball.
S06E23,The Face Painter,Jerry,"Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?"
S07E01,The Engagement,Jerry,How come you're eating your peas one at a time?

S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Nazi,"Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in my line!"
S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Elaine,"So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Kramer,I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Jerry,"Elaine, let the man make his soup!"
S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Nazi,You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's time.
S07E06,The Soup Nazi,Elaine,You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!

S07E08,The Pool Guy,Kramer,"Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you."

S07E08,The Pool Guy,George,"You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?"
S07E08,The Pool Guy,Kramer,"Hewwo and welcome to Movie phone. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one."

S07E09,The Sponge,Elaine,"Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy."

S07E09,The Sponge,Kramer,"Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon."
S07E09,The Sponge,Elaine,"So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
S07E09,The Sponge,Kramer,This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
S07E09,The Sponge,Jerry,She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
S07E11,The Rye,Frank,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"
S07E11,The Rye,Frank,That's perverse.
S07E11,The Rye,Frank,And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!

S07E11,The Rye,Kramer,The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
S07E12,The Caddy,George,How? Cause I'm an Idiot.

S07E12,The Caddy,Jerry,She's your Lex Luthor!
S07E12,The Caddy,Jerry,Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
S07E12,The Caddy,Jackie,"So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin' around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions!"
S07E12,The Caddy,Jackie,"That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!"
S07E12,The Caddy,Estelle,Are you sure you're talking about George?
S07E12,The Caddy,Frank,"Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr. Steinbrenner's here, George is dead, call me back!"

S07E14,The Cadillac (1),Jerry,"Oh, I'm back, baby."
S07E14,The Cadillac (1),Kramer,"Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting."
S07E15,The Cadillac (2),George,He's an importer-exporter.
S07E16,The Shower Head,Jerry,"I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!"
S07E16,The Shower Head,Peterman,"I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be accompanying me to Africa."
S07E16,The Shower Head,Peterman,"I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium."
S07E16,The Shower Head,Peterman,"That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally."
S07E16,The Shower Head,Peterman,"Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict, Elaine."
S07E16,The Shower Head,Kramer,If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
S07E16,The Shower Head,Newman,This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
S07E16,The Shower Head,Frank,Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
S07E16,The Shower Head,Kramer,It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
S07E16,The Shower Head,Elaine,"Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!"
S07E16,The Shower Head,Jerry,Poppy seeds!
S07E16,The Shower Head,George,So you're moving there for spite!
S07E16,The Shower Head,Frank,Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
S07E16,The Shower Head,George,Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
S07E16,The Shower Head,Morty,Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
S07E17,The Doll,George,"I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!"
S07E19,The Wig Master,George,Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
S07E19,The Wig Master,Jerry,........For spite...

S07E20,The Calzone,Jerry,Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
S07E20,The Calzone,Jerry,No. I never had a job.
S07E20,The Calzone,George,You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman.'Neither rain nor sleet nor snow.....'It's the first one.
S07E21,The Bottle Deposit (1),Jerry,"Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress."
S07E24,The Invitations,Doctor,Let me ask you ; Had she been exposed to any kind of inexpensive glue?

S08E01,The Foundation,Jerry,Star Trek II.
S08E01,The Foundation,George,"I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again."
S08E01,The Foundation,Elaine,"Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero."
S08E01,The Foundation,George,"I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple."
S08E01,The Foundation,Jerry,It's Dolores.
S08E01,The Foundation,Jerry,Isn't it Myanmar now?
S08E01,The Foundation,Jerry,"Kramer, you're fighting children?!"
S08E01,The Foundation,Jerry,"He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!"
S08E01,The Foundation,George,"Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!"
S08E02,The Soul Mate,Wyck,Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?

S08E02,The Soul Mate,Baines,Of course he killed her.
S08E03,The Bizarro Jerry,Jerry,She had man-hands.
S08E03,The Bizarro Jerry,Jerry,So he's Bizarro Jerry!
S08E03,The Bizarro Jerry,Leland,"Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks."
S08E03,The Bizarro Jerry,Kramer,I don't even really work here!
S08E04,The Little Kicks,Kramer,"It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich."
S08E04,The Little Kicks,George,Sweet Fancy Moses!
S08E04,The Little Kicks,George,It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
S08E04,The Little Kicks,Elaine,"Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear."
S08E05,The Package,Jerry,The timeless art of seduction.
S08E06,The Fatigues,Frank,"Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!"
S08E06,The Fatigues,Bania,"Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even Cynthia took me back."
S08E06,The Fatigues,George,Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
S08E06,The Fatigues,George,They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
S08E07,The Checks,Jerry,You have them sleeping in drawers?!
S08E07,The Checks,Wilhelm,"I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And, one day, we will do the cleaning."
S08E09,The Abstinence,Kramer,Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
S08E09,The Abstinence,Kramer,"Look away, I'm hideous."
S08E09,The Abstinence,George,"Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway."
S08E09,The Abstinence,Jackie,This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
S08E11,The Little Jerry,Elaine,"Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?"
S08E13,The Comeback,Reilly,"Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp."
S08E13,The Comeback,George,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'"
S08E13,The Comeback,Jerry,I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
S08E13,The Comeback,George,"Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself."
S08E13,The Comeback,Reilly,The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
S08E13,The Comeback,George,"Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife."
S08E14,The Van Buren Boys,Steven,I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
S08E14,The Van Buren Boys,Jerry,The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
S08E14,The Van Buren Boys,Jerry,"No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
S08E14,The Van Buren Boys,Jerry,I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
S08E16,The Pothole,Jerry,You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!

S08E19,The Yada Yada,Kramer,"Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."

S08E22,The Summer of George,Jerry,I've always wanted to do that...

S09E01,The Butter Shave,Kramer,"Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
S09E01,The Butter Shave,Elaine,"Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it."
S09E01,The Butter Shave,Jerry,Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
S09E01,The Butter Shave,Elaine,Vegetable Lasagna!
S09E01,The Butter Shave,Jerry,"What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?"
S09E02,The Voice,Jerry,"Sex, that's meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that's heavy. That's like an hour."

S09E08,The Betrayal,Susan,"Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister."
S09E09,The Apology,Jerry,"But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke."
S09E09,The Apology,Elaine,Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
S09E09,The Apology,George,Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
S09E09,The Apology,Elaine,"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep."
S09E09,The Apology,Elaine,"It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian."
S09E10,The Strike,Jerry,"And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?"
S09E10,The Strike,Jerry,And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
S09E10,The Strike,Jerry,Happy Festivus!
S09E10,The Strike,Kramer,What's Festivus?
S09E10,The Strike,George,Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
S09E10,The Strike,Elaine,"Happy Festivus, Georgie."
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"It was destroyed. But out of that, a new holiday was born. 'A Festivus for the rest of us!'"
S09E10,The Strike,George,The Human Fund.
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"And at the Festivus dinner, you gather your family around, and you tell them all the ways they have disappointed you over the past year."
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"No. Instead, there's a pole. It requires not decoration. I find tinsel distracting."
S09E10,The Strike,Kramer,"Well, Happy Festivus."
S09E10,The Strike,George,What is that? Is that the pole?!
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are."
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength."
S09E10,The Strike,Kruger,"George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund."
S09E10,The Strike,George,"Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus."
S09E10,The Strike,George,"Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!"
S09E10,The Strike,George,"Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to."
S09E10,The Strike,Kruger,I find your belief system fascinating.
S09E10,The Strike,Kramer,Another Festivus miracle!
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength."
S09E10,The Strike,George,Not the feats of strength..
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!"
S09E10,The Strike,Frank,"Stop crying, and fight your father!"
S09E11,The Dealership,George,"Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch."
S09E11,The Dealership,George,They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
S09E12,The Reverse Peephole (a.k.a. The Man Fur),Jerry,Cheapness is not a sense.
S09E12,The Reverse Peephole (a.k.a. The Man Fur),George,"Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money."
S09E12,The Reverse Peephole (a.k.a. The Man Fur),Elaine,It's not a purse. It's European.
S09E12,The Reverse Peephole (a.k.a. The Man Fur),Jerry,It's not a purse. It's European!

S09E18,The Frogger,Elaine,A little stale.
S09E18,The Frogger,Lubeck,"No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's."
S09E18,The Frogger,Jerry,Game over.
S09E19,The Maid,Kramer,"Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
