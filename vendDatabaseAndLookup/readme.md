## Workflow Summary

### 1. **Customer & Product Search**

- Staff can search for customers by name or company, OR by searching for order details (date, amount, invoice number)
- The **main dashboard** (`/index/`) provides a unified search bar with live filtering.
- Known customers get a detailed view (`/search-customer/customer-details.html`); unknown or walk-in customers get a simplified screen showing all unknown orders/unattributed (`/search-all/unknown-details.html`).

### 2. **PDF Generation and Printing**

- Invoices can be generated as PDFs if customers should request them (legally required).
- Last 10 generated PDFs are kept in `public/shared/pdfs/` for instant retrieval and reprinting.

### 3. **Styling & Customization**

- All UI components use shared styles (`public/shared/styles/`) and are easily themed.
- Logos can be swapped in `/assets/` for instant branding.
