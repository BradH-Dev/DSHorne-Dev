## Overview

This tool helps small businesses efficiently manage their Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) reports by:

- Uploading CoGS files exported from Square
- Automatically mapping categories to Xero sales accounts
- Optionally reconciling Square data with manual invoice data from Xero
- Generating two output files:
  - `upload_to_xero.csv`: ready for import into Xero's journal system
  - `check_uncategorised.csv`: shows uncategorised product totals and net figures excluding freight

---

## Workflow Summary

### 1. Map Square Categories

- The page auto-loads current categories from `categories.csv` and then updates them, based on all categories available in your Square account
- Each category is mapped via dropdown to a Xero account group:
  - **Leather**
  - **Leathercraft**
  - **Souvenirs**
- Your selections are saved immediately to disk

### 2. Upload Square CoGS File

**Export from Square:**

- Go to **Reports ‚Üí Inventory reports ‚Üí Cost of Goods Sold**
- Set your desired **date range**
- Click **Export** to download the CSV

**In the tool:**

- Click `üìÅ Choose Cost of Goods file from Square`
- Wait for the file to upload and validate

### 3. Generate Report

- Click **Generate report...**
- You‚Äôll be asked whether to include **manual invoices** which were generated earlier and imported to Xero:
  - **Yes**: Enter the same start/end date range used in Square
  - **No**: Continue using Square data only

The tool will:

- Stream backend progress in real time
- Generate and auto-download:
  - `upload_to_xero.csv` - for importing into Xero
  - `check_uncategorised.csv` - for uncategorised reconciliation

## Importing into Xero

3. Review and edit the **draft journal** created in Xero
4. Use `check_uncategorised.csv` to reconcile:
   - Missing categories
   - Freight/postage-related discrepancies
