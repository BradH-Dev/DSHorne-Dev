Keep the 'Sales' selection as 'Sales' <br><br><strong>4)</strong> Click 'Export'. This will download a file from Square <br><br><br><strong>Using this tool:</strong><br><br><strong>1)</strong> This page will pull all the current top-level categories off Square. Ensure they are each mapped to the correct sales account on Xero by using the dropdowns.<br><br><strong>2)</strong> Click 'üìÅ Choose Cost of Goods file from Square' and select the file which was downloaded from Square, and wait for it to upload and process. <br><br><strong>3)</strong> When instructed, click 'Generate report...' <br><br> <strong>4)</strong> You will be prompted if you want to include invoices. <br><br> Putting it simply, CoGS from Square will ONLY include sales from the following places: <br><br><em>Online sales (leathercraft and souvenirs, NOT leather), in-store sales, and Square-created invoices.</em><br><br>Any custom invoices (i.e. Xero invoices using the custom tool) will not have CoGS from the Square export. By selecting 'Yes' to include invoices, it will account for <strong>ALL</strong> CoGS across the business.<br><br>Selecting 'No' will mean just exporting CoGS from the Square sources listed above. <br><br> <strong>5)</strong> Follow the status messages as they appear. The process may take a while if the cost of goods report is large. Two files will download. <br><br><br><strong>Importing to Xero:</strong><br><br><strong>1)</strong> Click the button 'Take me to Xero imports...'<br><br> <strong>2)</strong> From there, browse for the file called 'upload_to_xero' and import it. <br><br> <strong>3)</strong> This will create a draft journal. Click it and edit as required. Open up the generated 'check_uncategorised' file to reconcile any small amounts which have come through uncategorised <br><br>3.5) The uncategorised file will tally all freight/postage related costs and give you a net total of all uncategorised products WITHOUT freight in the end column to give you a clearer picture", "OK - Makes sense :)");
